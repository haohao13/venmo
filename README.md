# Text, Social Network and Predictive Analytics for Venmo using PySpark

Based on Venmo transaction data (2TB), emoji and word dictionary, classified the transactions into different categories, calculated user dynamic spending profile, social network metrics (friends and friends of friends) and transaction RF (recency and frequency) at different user lifetime point using PySpark. Finally, regressed these variables on the total number of transactions at lifetime point 12 for each lifetime point and plotted the MSE to find the most influential factors.
